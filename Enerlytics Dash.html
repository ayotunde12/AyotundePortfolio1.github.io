										<h3>Project Overview: Enerlytix Dashboard</h3>
										<p>This interactive dashboard presents a detailed analysis of energy consumption, cost, and carbon emissions across multiple cities and time periods. The project began with rigorous data cleaning and transformation in Microsoft Excel, where raw records were validated, missing values addressed and data types standardized for consistency. Key columns such as energy type, cost, emissions and usage metrics were thoroughly prepared for accurate downstream analysis.</p>
										<p>Power BI was used to create a dynamic dashboard revealing key insights on renewable vs non-renewable energy use, cost, trends, and carbon footprint. It helped identify where and when energy was most consumed, and which cities and sources drove the highest emissions and costs. The goal was to support energy managers and policymakers in making data-driven decisions to cut emissions, control costs and promote greener strategies.</p>
										<h3>Energy Consumption & ESG Impact Analysis</h3>
										<p>This section presents a data backed overview of energy usage trends across multiple locations from January 2023 to May 2025, highlighting both environmental and financial implications. The dataset comprises 20,000+ transaction level energy records, spanning renewable and non-renewable sources.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Total energy consumption reached 56.87M kWh, with 58% derived from renewable sources (33M kWh) and 42% from non-renewables (23.85M kWh).</li>
											<li>Based on a standardized emission factor of 389.82 kg CO₂/kWh, non-renewable sources alone generated 9.3B kg of CO₂ emissions, driving climate risk exposure in carbon heavy regions.</li>
											<li>At an average market rate of $0.17/kWh, the total energy spend was estimated at $9.67M, with non-renewables accounting for 58.06% of total cost highlighting the premium paid for dirtier energy.</li>
											<li>Locations heavily reliant on fossil energy showed cost volatility up to +35% during peak demand months, impacting operational budgets and bottom line forecasts.</li>
											<li>A steady shift toward renewable adoption was evident between 2023 and 2025, signaling maturing sustainability strategies and regulatory alignment with green finance frameworks.</li>

											<h3> Problem Statement & Proposed Solution</h3>
											<p>Energy consumption continues to rise, straining city budgets and increasing carbon emissions, while stakeholders often lack a unified and data driven view of usage, costs, and environmental impact. This dashboard bridges that gap by providing a visual and interactive platform that displays monthly trends, cost spikes, and emissions by city and energy type. It empowers energy planners, sustainability teams, and decision makers to identify high cost and high emission areas, promote renewable energy, plan efficient policies and track progress toward carbon neutrality. By visualizing these insights in real time, the dashboard supports smarter and greener decisions aligned with economic and environmental goals.</p>

											<h3>Key Takeaway & Next Steps</h3>
											<p>This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, Excel modeling, SQL querying and Power BI visualization. It also deepened my understanding of sustainability metrics and real world implications of energy usage. Moving forward, I plan to integrate predictive modeling and machine learning to forecast energy demand and emissions, and possibly incorporate real time IoT data from smart meters for more dynamic monitoring and alerts.</p>
