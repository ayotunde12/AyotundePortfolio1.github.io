										<h3>Project Overview</h3>
										<p>This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of employee distribution, tenure, gender diversity, and workforce planning across the organization. Designed to support HR teams and business leaders, it transforms complex human capital data into clear, visual insights. By highlighting patterns in tenure and gender representation, the dashboard helps identify trends and potential areas for improvement in workforce diversity and retention.</p>
										<p>Additionally, the dashboard includes retirement forecasts and workforce projections, equipping leadership with the data needed to plan proactively. These insights enable strategic staffing decisions that align with long-term organizational goals, promoting sustainable growth and operational stability.</p>
										<h3>Workforce Demographics & Tenure Insightse</h3>
										<p>The organization workforce is moderately gender-balanced and demonstrates strong employee retention, with a significant number of staff serving for many years. This trend reflects a stable and experienced workforce, highlighting a culture that values long-term commitment while also signaling the need for thoughtful succession planning as more employees approach retirement. This include: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>A total workforce of 1,470 employees (882 males, 588 females).</li>
											<li>Over 202 employees with more than 10 years of service.</li>
											<li>40 employees with 15 years of service — the highest tenure group.</li>
											<li>Mid-level tenure groups: 96 with 9 years, 103 with 8 years, and 125 with 6 years.</li>
											<li>These patterns emphasize retention strength and the importance of leadership pipeline development.</li>
										</ul>

											<h3>Problem Statement & Proposed Solution</h3>
											<p>With 117 employees projected for retirement soon and 1,353 active employees remaining, effective workforce planning has become a critical priority. The organization faces the challenge of maintaining productivity, preserving institutional knowledge, and preparing for potential skill gaps that may arise due to the loss of experienced staff. To address these challenges, proposed solutions include implementing knowledge transfer programs for retiring staff, developing a strong talent pipeline through internal promotions, and enhancing recruitment efforts in areas where experience gaps are anticipated. Additionally, regularly reviewing workforce demographics will support organizational resilience. This dashboard plays a key role as a proactive tool, enabling HR and leadership to tackle these issues with data-driven confidence.</p>

											<h3>Key Takeaway & Next Steps</h3>
											<p>This project enhanced my ability to translate workforce data into actionable business insights through the effective use of PowerBI & SQL. It enabled the identification of key HR metrics such as retention strengths and potential retirement risks—both critical to strategic workforce planning. Moving forward, I plan to integrate predictive modeling capabilities into the dashboard to forecast attrition rates and recommend data-driven hiring strategies, further supporting long-term workforce stability and organizational growth.</p>
