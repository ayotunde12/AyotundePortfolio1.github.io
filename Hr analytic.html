										<h3>Project Overview</h3>
										<p>This analysis focuses on understanding employee attrition within a company of 1,470 employees. With an overall attrition rate of 16.12%, the study explores critical areas such as attrition by gender, department impact, education background, age distribution, and job satisfaction levels. The insights aim to reveal patterns and identify vulnerable segments within the workforce.</p>
										<p>Through detailed examination of employee demographics and satisfaction ratings, the project uncovers the underlying drivers of attrition. This helps provide strategic recommendations for enhancing employee retention, improving department-specific engagement, and supporting long-term organizational stability.</p>
										<h3>Data Highlights & Observations</h3>
										<p>A closer look at key metrics reveals important trends across gender, departments, age groups, job satisfaction levels, and educational backgrounds that directly influence employee attrition. These include: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Attrition by Gender: 87 females and 150 males left the organization, indicating a slightly higher male attrition.</li>
											<li>Departmental Impact: R&D accounted for the highest attrition (56.12%), followed by Sales (38.82%), while HR had a relatively small share (5.06%).</li>
											<li>Age Distribution: The largest group of employees falls in the 33-year age range (213 employees), suggesting a relatively young and mid-career workforce.
											</li>
											<li>Job Satisfaction: Sales Executives scored the highest job satisfaction, whereas the Human Resources department recorded the lowest satisfaction rate at just 52%.</li>
											<li>Education and Attrition: Employees with Bachelor’s degrees were the most prone to attrition (99 exits), followed by Master’s and Associate degree holders.</li>

											<h3>Problem Statement & Proposed Solution</h3>
											<p>High attrition in key departments like R&D and Sales threatens company productivity and knowledge retention, while low satisfaction in HR risks weakening overall employee morale.

												To address this, targeted exit interviews, mentorship programs, and career development initiatives should be implemented, with special focus on R&D and Sales. Improving engagement within HR and tailoring retention strategies based on education and career stage will further strengthen employee retention.</p>

											<h3>Key Takeaway & Next Steps</h3>
											<p>Attrition impacts certain groups more heavily, especially R&D employees and those with Bachelor’s degrees, highlighting the need for a targeted, data-driven retention strategy. Next steps include investigating R&D and Sales attrition causes, creating department-specific action plans, monitoring job satisfaction quarterly, and launching tailored career growth initiatives for mid-career employees.</p>
