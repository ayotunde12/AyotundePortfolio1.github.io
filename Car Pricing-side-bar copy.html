										<h3>Project Overview</h3>
										<p>This Power BI dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of car pricing trends in Nigeria, drawing insights from a dataset of 4,095 cars across 49 unique car makes. The primary goal of the project is to simplify the car-buying process for Nigerians by presenting complex pricing data in an easy-to-understand visual format. Through interactive charts and filters, users can explore how car prices vary based on brand, year of manufacture, engine size, and mileage, enabling them to make more informed and confident purchasing decisions.</p>
										<p>The analysis places particular emphasis on popular brands in the Nigerian market, such as Toyota, Lexus, and Kia. By highlighting these key players, the dashboard helps potential buyers recognize the value and pricing patterns associated with each brand. Whether a user is buying their first car or looking to upgrade, this tool empowers them with data-driven insights into what influences car prices, ultimately making the vehicle selection process more transparent and efficient.</p>
										<h3>Market Breakdown & Trends</h3>
										<p>The dashboard reveals key insights about the Nigerian car market:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Brand Dominance: Toyota, Lexus, and Kia are the most frequently listed brands, highlighting their popularity, reliability, and strong resale value in the Nigerian market.</li>
											<li>Year vs. Price: There is a clear correlation between the year of manufacture and car pricingâ€”newer models generally cost more, although certain older models retain high value due to strong brand reputation.</li>
											<li>Engine Size Impact: Cars with larger engine capacities tend to have lower market prices, likely due to higher fuel consumption and maintenance costs.</li>
											<li>Mileage Sensitivity: Vehicles with higher mileage often experience depreciation, as buyers associate them with greater wear and tear.</li>
											<li>Market Insights: With data from over 4,000 vehicles, the dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of pricing trends, supporting both buyers and dealers in making informed, cost-effective decisions.</li>

											<h3>Problem Statement & Proposed Solution</h3>
											<p>Navigating the used car market in Nigeria can be difficult, largely due to inconsistent pricing and limited access to reliable data. Many buyers end up overpaying or face challenges in determining the true market value of a vehicle. This lack of transparency often leads to poor purchasing decisions and missed opportunities for better deals.

												This Power BI dashboard tackles these issues by centralizing pricing information across various car brands, models, and years of manufacture. With interactive filters and comparison tools based on engine size, mileage, and other key factors, users can quickly identify fair market values. The dashboard empowers buyers to negotiate more effectively, avoid overpriced listings, and discover hidden deals, ultimately bringing clarity and confidence to the car-buying process.</p>

											<h3>Key Takeaway & Next Steps</h3>
											<p>This project sharpened my skills in transforming raw automotive data into actionable insights using PowerBI & SQL. It demonstrates the power of data in guiding smarter purchase decisions in everyday markets like automobile sales. As a next step, I plan to expand the dataset to include more vehicle brands and introduce real-time scraping from car listing platforms for live pricing updates.</p>
