										<h3>Project Overview: Vehicle Theft Analysis</h3>
										<p>This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of vehicle theft patterns and their geographical spread across different regions. The project began with extensive data cleaning and preparation using Microsoft Excel, where the raw data was structured, validated, and refined to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency. This foundational step was crucial in eliminating duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats, which laid the groundwork for a reliable and insightful analysis. Once the data was properly structured, Power BI was employed to create dynamic visualizations that reveal underlying trends, such as frequency of thefts, high-risk areas, and temporal spikes in incidents.</p>
										<p>The main objective of this analysis was to empower law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and other stakeholders with actionable insights to combat vehicle theft more effectively. By highlighting theft hotspots, identifying commonly stolen vehicle models, and breaking down data by regions and time periods, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making. These insights can be used to allocate resources more efficiently, implement targeted security measures, and enhance public awareness in vulnerable areas. Ultimately, the dashboard serves as a strategic tool to improve response efforts and reduce the overall incidence of vehicle theft.</p>
										<h3>Regional Insights & Population Analysis</h3>
										<p>This section explores how vehicle thefts are distributed across regions in relation to population size, highlighting the most affected areas and potential links to population density. The analysis covers 4,553 reported thefts across 13 regions with a combined population of 5 million, spanning from October 7, 2021, to April 6, 2022. Key insights are summarized below:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Auckland recorded the highest number of vehicle thefts with 1,638 stolen vehicles, despite having a population of 1.695 million, making it the most significantly affected region overall..</li>
											<li>Canterbury followed with 660 thefts, against a population of 655,000, placing it among the top three regions with the highest theft rates.</li>
											<li>Bay of Plenty, although smaller with a population of 348,000, reported a relatively high 446 stolen vehicles, ranking it as the second most affected region when adjusted for population size.</li>
											<li>The average number of stolen vehicles per region was approximately 350, reflecting a widespread issue across the country rather than being confined to just a few areas.</li>
											<li>A notable increase in thefts was observed between October 2021 and March 2022, indicating a rising trend in vehicle-related crimes during this period.</li>

											<h3> Problem Statement & Proposed Solution</h3>
											<p>The rise in vehicle theft presents a growing challenge for public safety, regional authorities, and car owners. Many regions lacked clear data-driven insights into where and what types of vehicles were most at risk. This dashboard was created to bridge that gap by providing an interactive, visual platform that highlights theft trends over time, across regions, and by vehicle type. It empowers stakeholders—such as law enforcement, policy makers, and community leaders—with actionable information to improve surveillance in high-risk areas, allocate security resources more efficiently, and educate the public on vehicle safety. Ultimately, this solution aims to reduce theft incidents, shorten recovery time, and enhance overall community security.</p>

											<h3>Key Takeaway & Next Steps</h3>
											<p>This project strengthened my skills in data wrangling and visual analytics using Excel, PowerBI & SQL. It provided actionable insights into vehicle theft patterns, aiding security strategies. Next, I plan to integrate real-time data and apply predictive analytics to enhance the dashboard's effectiveness in preventing future thefts.</p>
