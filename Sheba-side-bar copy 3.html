										<h3>Project Overview</h3>
										<p>The Sheba Medical Center Dashboard is a healthcare analytics project developed to enhance decision-making within hospital management. Utilizing Microsoft Excel and Power BI, the dashboard provides detailed insights into key operational areas such as billing, treatment costs, departmental efficiency, and patient insurance coverage. By centralizing this data, the tool allows stakeholders—including administrators, finance teams, and department heads—to monitor and assess critical performance metrics in real time.</p>
										<p>With an emphasis on transparency and performance, the dashboard supports improved hospital operations and smarter resource allocation. Interactive visual reports make it easy to identify trends, track patient satisfaction levels, and understand revenue sources. Ultimately, this tool empowers healthcare leaders to make informed, data-driven decisions that contribute to better patient care and organizational efficiency.</p>

											<h3>Problem Statement & Proposed Solution</h3>
											<p>Hospitals often face challenges in monitoring financial health and efficiently allocating resources due to fragmented data across various departments. As healthcare costs rise and insurance processes become more complex, having a unified view of financial and procedural performance is essential for effective decision-making.To address this, the Sheba Medical Center Dashboard consolidates billing, diagnosis, treatment, and insurance data into a single interactive platform. It empowers hospital executives to monitor cost drivers and revenue streams, track departmental performance, and optimize resource use. Additionally, the dashboard highlights top-billed procedures and diagnoses, while identifying areas with high out-of-pocket expenses to support better patient financial planning.</p>

											<h3>Key Takeaway & Next Steps</h3>
											<p>This project expanded my expertise in healthcare data analytics, particularly in handling sensitive billing information and translating it into meaningful insights using excel, PowerBI & SQL. It demonstrates how business intelligence tools can directly support better healthcare administration. As a next step, I plan to integrate patient feedback metrics and real-time updates to further improve care quality and financial transparency.</p>
